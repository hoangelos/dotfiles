#Solarized Light-Dark Toggle

##Introduction
Solarized Light-Dark Toggle is a very simple plugin which allows users of [Sublime Text 2][st2] and [Sublime Text 3][st3] to easily switch between light and dark versions of the Solarized color scheme.

Instead of having to manually click Preferences->Color Scheme->Solarized (\[Light|Dark\]), you can simply press F12 in order to toggle between the light and dark themes.
